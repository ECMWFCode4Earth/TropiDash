## Project abstract

This project will produce a platform on Jupyter notebooks able to visualize key meteorological parameters in plots and maps to better understand tropical cyclone hazards evolution. It will gather the currently used and most effective visualizations and reproduce them in a dashboard applying interactive elements. The end user will be provided with sound documentation which will enable the platform usage and enhancement after the end of the project. The development of the project is envisioned following 4 major phases:
1. Existing context recognition
2. Platform design
3. Platform development
4. Ensure the future maintenance
