# TropiDash Documentation for User support

Welcome to the User Support Documentation for **TropiDash**, an innovative dashboard designed for the visualization and display of tropical cyclone data. Developed using Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment, TropiDash harnesses the power of coding to deliver dynamic insights into tropical cyclones hazard and impacts. As part of the Code for Earth initiative by the European Centre of Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF), this dashboard represents a collaborative effort to provide accessible and actionable information about tropical cyclones. TropiDash is organized into five distinct sections, each offering unique perspectives on tropical cyclones:

1. Tropical Cyclone Tracks and Characteristics 
2. Atmospheric Variables 
3. Impact Variables
4. Multi-Layer Map combining data from all previous sections
5. Point-Wise Temporal Evolution of Atmospheric Variables

Whether you're a weather enthusiast, a researcher, or a decision-maker, this documentation will guide you through using TropiDash effectively.
To support you for an effective use of the dashboard please also refer to the tutorials specific for each section in jupyter notebook. You can find them in the __[tutorials folder](https://github.com/ECMWFCode4Earth/TropiDash/tree/main/tutorials)__.

## Section 1 - Tropical Cyclone Tracks and Characteristics

In this section, our primary goal is to provide users with a comprehensive view of tropical cyclones by visualizing both observed and forecasted tracks, as well as crucial additional information. Here, you'll find four main layers at your disposal: the Ensemble Forecast Tracks, the Observed Track, the Average Forecast Track, and the Strike Probability Map. These layers collectively offer a comprehensive understanding of cyclone behavior, enabling you to assess the potential impact of these powerful weather phenomena. Whether you're tracking the historical path of a cyclone, examining the consensus of future forecasts, or gauging the likelihood of a strike in a particular area, this section equips you with the tools you need to stay informed about cyclones positions and future developments.
