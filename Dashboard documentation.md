# TropiDash Documentation for User support

Welcome to the User Support Documentation for **TropiDash**, an innovative dashboard designed for the visualization and display of tropical cyclone data. Developed using Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment, TropiDash harnesses the power of coding to deliver dynamic insights into tropical cyclones hazard and impacts. As part of the Code for Earth initiative by the European Centre of Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF), this dashboard represents a collaborative effort to provide accessible and actionable information about tropical cyclones. TropiDash is organized into five distinct sections, each offering unique perspectives on tropical cyclones:
 
1. Tropical Cyclone Tracks and Characteristics 
2. Atmospheric Variables 
3. Impact Variables
4. Multi-Layer Maps combining data from all sections
5. Point-Wise Temporal Evolution of Atmospheric Variables

Whether you're a weather enthusiast, a researcher, or a decision-maker, this documentation will guide you through using TropiDash effectively.
